                  Please excuse our mess.  We're still currently working on this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Below you will find a list of the most recent <%= @events.length %> seismic
                  events we have records for (also available as
                  <a href="<%= url('/events.json') %>">JSON</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that this feed is good for real time monitoring (be polite though!),
                  but if you seek historical data it's best if you contact us directly so
                  that we can provide a data dump.
