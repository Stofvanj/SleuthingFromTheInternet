Sleuthing From the Internet
===========================

Sleuthing from the Internet is a tool inspired by Jeffrey Lewis's post
(http://lewis.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/5534/my-own-sleuthing-from-home) on
the value of seismic data in detecting "Seismic Source Physics Experiments", or
in layman's terms: big booms.

The post discusses the challenges involved in using certain data sources that
can suddenly disappear.  This project seeks to aggregate relevant sources so
as to avoid this unfortunate set of circumstances, and provide automated
detection algorithms to alert interested parties of potential interesting
events.

Data Sources
============

Currently data is being culled from the USGS GEOJSON feed on an hourly basis
(details can be found in the scraper at lib/tasks/scheduler.rake).
